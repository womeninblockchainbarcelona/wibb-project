## Where Do We Come From?

## Biggest Picture Overview
The technological progress that brings blockchain implies a convergence of all disciplines of knowledge in a way never seen before.
Thinking about how our society organizes, we can identify different layers.
On the bottom layer we have the basic understanding of the primary pillars that sustain everything else. This means, redefining the bottom layer is changing the way we organize and think of a society today.

# About the WIBB Project
## Aim
Women In Blockchain Barcelona (WIBB) is much more than a group of people who meetup from time to time to discuss a specific topic, that’s why we talk about the “WIBB Project”.
The first aim of this project is to share and expand a deep understanding on what blockchain is and why it is important for our society, through a women voice. 
The end goal is to culminate this knowledge in a tool that people can use to contribute on redefining the layers above expose. 
By this we can transform the structures that hold the system of our societies we know today, in a non-precedent way.
## Target
Our target audience are people motivated with this technological/social and economical change we are living. People who want to know more and xx
Everyone can attend to the events we organize.
We specially encourage people from different backgrounds, since this will enrich our community and give us other insights and perspectives.
## Structure
WIBB Project is build upon 2 vertex: the events and the platform. These 2 vertex nourish each other and reinforce the global aim of the project.
### WIBB Events
The WIBB events are classified on:
* talks
* technical workshops
* networking events
* panel discussion

The common denominator of these events is that the speakers/leads are always women.
Each event will be focused to address a specific topic. This topic will be classified in one of the 6 topics we have defined (can be redefined in the course of our experience).
The idea is to fulfill each of these categories with knowledge, insights and ideas coming from the events. These categories, will interconnect with each other (still tbd). 
How will we achieve this? With the help of the WIBB Platform. 
### Platform
WIBB Platform will gather all the know-how derived from the events. This is extremely necessary in order to build a structure around them.
The idea, still in its concept, is to create a system where participants can connect knowledge. The interesting thing here is connecting knowledge from different disciplines (with the common nexus of blockchain).  WIBB Platform will also act as the event “connecting-thread”.
First approach would be a decentralized platform on top of Ethereum deployed on IPFS.
The basis of the needed features is currently under definition, hoping receiving more inputs derived from the future event themselves.
